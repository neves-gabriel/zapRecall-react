# ZapRecall

Implementation of a flashcard app called Zap Recall in React!</br>
Flashcards are cards that contain a question/statement in front of them and an answer in the back. You can use them to train your memory with *Active Recall* and *Spaced Repetition* methodologies. The idea is to read the question or statement and try to remember the answer, when faced with it, depending on the effort required to answer or not the flashcard, you are aware of which content is fresh in memory and which is not, so you can often practice content that is not.</br>
Flashcard sets are called decks, this app has by default at least one deck with 8 questions.</br>
The app helps us by showing the deck's flashcards and giving us the option to let us know whether or not we remember the content of the flashcard presented. When we instantly remembered a flashcard, we had a "Zap!"
